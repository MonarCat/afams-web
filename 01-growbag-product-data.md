# Copilot Prompt — 01: Add GrowBag to Existing Product Data
# Scope: Add GrowBag entries to the existing products array/object in the site JS.
# Rule: Do NOT touch SuChai Classic, SuChai Vertical, or ProSoil entries.
#       Do NOT change cart logic, checkout, or Paystack integration.
#       Only ADD new entries. Follow the exact same data structure already in use.

## Context

The site at afams.co.ke has a products array in its main JavaScript file (likely `js/main.js`,
`js/products.js`, `js/app.js`, or inline in `index.html` — find it by searching for
`'SuChai Classic'` or `suchai-classic` in the codebase).

The existing products follow a consistent data structure. Identify that structure exactly —
field names, property types, SKU format, price format — and replicate it precisely for
the new GrowBag entries below.

## New Product: Afams GrowBag

The GrowBag is a new, simpler product line being added below the existing SuChais.
It comes in **5 sizes × 2 shape variants = 10 SKUs total**.

### Shape variants
- **Wide** — standard cylindrical shape, broad and squat. Similar footprint to the existing
  SuChai Classic. Best for balconies, rooftops, and patios where floor space is available.
- **Compact** — narrower and taller profile. Best for small balconies, tight corners,
  and spaces where width is limited.

## Implementation instructions

1. **Find** the existing products array/object in the codebase. Search for `'SuChai Classic'`
   or `suchai-classic` to locate it.

2. **Inspect** the exact data structure of one existing product entry — every field name,
   value type, and pattern.

3. **Add** all 10 GrowBag SKU entries at the END of the existing products array,
   after ProSoil. Do not reorder existing entries.

4. **Match** the exact field names and structure of existing entries. If existing entries
   use `productName`, use `productName` — not `name`. If they use `priceKES`, use
   `priceKES`. Do not invent new field names unless the GrowBag genuinely needs them
   (size, variant, volume — these are new and must be added).

5. **Add these three new fields** that GrowBag entries need and existing products don't have:
   ```
   size: 'Mini' | 'Medium' | 'Standard' | 'Large' | 'XL'
   variant: 'Wide' | 'Compact'
   volume: '8 L'   // string, matches values in matrix above
   ```
   These fields will be used by the product card selector (Prompt 02).

6. **Do not add** a separate section label or category header in the data — that is handled
   in the HTML (Prompt 02).
